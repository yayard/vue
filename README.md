# Vue.js Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) app that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example 

To get started with Vue.js on Now, you can use the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#vue-create) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ vue create
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Vue.js example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
